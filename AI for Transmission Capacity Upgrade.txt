# AI for Transmission Capacity Upgrade

This mini AI project predicts whether a fiber or microwave link requires a capacity upgrade, based on historical network KPI data.

## Features
- Realistic dummy data for 500 links
- KPI analysis (traffic utilization, BER, latency, jitter)
- Machine learning model using Random Forest
- Feature importance visualization

## Files
- `ai_transmission_upgrade.ipynb`: Main notebook
- `link_kpi_data_dummy.csv`: Simulated dataset
